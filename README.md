# fGAN

An fGAN is a meta algorthim for GANs based on the fictitious play algorithm in game theory.
The paper in which it was introduced can be found here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08647

The code for the pytorch GAN implementation used in our code can be found here:
https://github.com/devnag/pytorch-generative-adversarial-networks

It's currently implemented on MOGs - that's the file fGAN.py
